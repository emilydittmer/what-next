# What Next?

## Description

What Next? is a solo project focused on the React, Redux, Router, Enzyme/Jest, and fetching API calls, the concepts learned in the last six weeks. This app allows a user to enter in a recently completed TV show and find suggestions based on that show. The user can then add any show to their watchlist. Once a show is added to the watchlist, they will be able to view all selected shows and remove them.
